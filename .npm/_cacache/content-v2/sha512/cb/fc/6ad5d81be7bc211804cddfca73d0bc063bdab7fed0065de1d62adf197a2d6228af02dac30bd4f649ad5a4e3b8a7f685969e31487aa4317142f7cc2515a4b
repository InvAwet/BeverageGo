It is not designed to be used as a standalone library but rather as a dependency of a [full-featured navigation library](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).\n\n## Fabric\n\nTo learn about how to use `react-native-screens` with Fabric architecture, head over to [Fabric README](README-Fabric.md). Instructions on how to run Fabric Example within this repo can be found in the [FabricExample README](FabricExample/README.md).\n\n## Supported platforms\n\n- [x] iOS\n- [x] Android\n- [x] tvOS\n- [x] visionOS\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Web\n\n## Installation\n\n### iOS\n\nInstallation on iOS is completely handled with auto-linking, if you have ensured pods are installed after adding this module, no other actions are necessary.\n\n### Android\n\nOn Android the View state is not persisted consistently across Activity restarts, which can lead to crashes in those cases. It is recommended to override the native Android method called on Activity restarts in your main Activity, to avoid these crashes.\n\nFor most people using an app built from the react-native template, that means editing `MainActivity.java`, likely located in `android/app/src/main/java/<your package name>/MainActivity.java`\n\nYou should add this code, which specifically discards any Activity state persisted during the Activity restart process, to avoid inconsistencies that lead to crashes.\nPlease note that the override code should not be placed inside `MainActivityDelegate`, but rather directly in `MainActivity`.\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Java</summary>\n\n```java\nimport android.os.Bundle;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n\n    //...code\n\n    //react-native-screens override\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(null);\n    }\n\n    public static class MainActivityDelegate extends ReactActivityDelegate {\n        //...code\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Kotlin</summary>\n\n```kotlin\nimport android.os.Bundle;\n\nclass MainActivity: ReactActivity() {\n\n    //...code\n\n    //react-native-screens override\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n      super.onCreate(null);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nFor people that must handle cases like this, there is [a more detailed discussion of the difficulties in a series of related comments](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/17#issuecomment-424704633).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Need to use a custom Kotlin version?</summary>\n<br>\n\nSince `v3.6.0` `react-native-screens` has been rewritten with Kotlin. Kotlin version used in this library defaults to `1.4.10`.\n\nIf you need to use a different Kotlin version, set `kotlinVersion` ext property in your project's `android/build.gradle` and the library will use this version accordingly:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    ext {\n        ...\n        kotlinVersion = \"1.4.10\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Disclaimer**: `react-native-screens` requires Kotlin `1.3.50` or higher.\n\n</details>\n\n### Windows\n\nInstallation on Windows should be completely handled with auto-linking when using React Native Windows 0.63+. For earlier versions, you must [manually link](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/native-modules-using) the native module.\n\n## How can I take advantage of that?\n\nScreens are already integrated with the React Native's most popular navigation library [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) and [Expo](https://expo.io).\n\n## Supported react-native version\n\nBelow we present tables with mapping of the library version to the last supported react-native version. These tables are for the `4.x` line of the library. For compat tables \nof `3.x` line please see [readme on the `3.x` branch](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/tree/3.x?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-react-native-version).\n\n### Support for Paper\n\nPaper is the default rendering system for React Native versions prior to 0.76.\n\n| library version | react-native version |\n| --------------- | -------------------- |\n| 4.9.0+          | 0.76.0+              |\n| 4.5.0+          | 0.74.0+              |\n| 4.0.0+          | 0.72.0+              |\n\n### Support for Fabric\n\n[Fabric](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/fabric-renderer) is React Native's new rendering system.\n\nHere's a table with summary of supported `react-native` versions when Fabric is turned on.\n\n| library version | react-native version |\n| --------------- | -------------------- |\n| 4.5.0+          | 0.77.0+              |\n| 4.0.0+          | 0.76.0+              |\n\n## Usage with [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> JS API of the native stack has been moved from `react-native-screens/native-stack` to `@react-navigation/native-stack` since version v6. Currently, native stack v5 (imported from `react-native-screens/native-stack`) is deprecated and will be removed in the upcoming **minor** release. `react-native-screens` v4 will support only `@react-navigation/native-stack` v7.\n\nScreens support is built into [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) starting from version [2.14.0](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.14.0) for all the different navigator types (stack, tab, drawer, etc).\n\nTo configure react-navigation to use screens instead of plain RN Views for rendering screen views, simply add this library as a dependency to your project:\n\n```bash\n# bare React Native project\nyarn add react-native-screens\n\n# if you use Expo managed workflow\nnpx expo install react-native-screens\n```\n\nJust make sure that the version of [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) you are using is 2.14.0 or higher.\n\nYou are all set 🎉 – when screens are enabled in your application code react-navigation will automatically use them instead of relying on plain React Native Views.\n\n### Experimental support for `react-freeze`\n\n> You have to use React Native 0.68 or higher, react-navigation 5.x or 6.x and react-native-screens >= v3.9.0\n\nSince `v3.9.0`, `react-native-screens` comes with experimental support for [`react-freeze`](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-freeze). It uses the React `Suspense` mechanism to prevent parts of the React component tree from rendering, while keeping its state untouched.\n\nTo benefit from this feature, enable it in your entry file (e.g. `App.js`) with this snippet:\n\n```js\nimport { enableFreeze } from 'react-native-screens';\n\nenableFreeze(true);\n```\n\nWant to know more? Check out [react-freeze README](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-freeze#readme)\n\nFound a bug? File an issue [here](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues) or directly in [react-freeze repository](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-freeze/issues).\n\n### Disabling `react-native-screens`\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you'd like to disable native screens support and use plain React Native Views add the following code in your entry file (e.g. `App.js`):\n\n```js\nimport { enableScreens } from 'react-native-screens';\n\nenableScreens(false);\n```\n\nYou can also disable the usage of native screens per navigator with [`detachInactiveScreens`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator#detachinactivescreens).\n\n### Using `createNativeStackNavigator` with React Navigation\n\nTo take advantage of the native stack navigator primitive for React Navigation that leverages `UINavigationController` on iOS and `Fragment` on Android, please refer:\n\n- for React Navigation >= v6 to the [Native Stack Navigator part of React Navigation documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator)\n\n## `FullWindowOverlay`\n\nNative `iOS` component for rendering views straight under the `Window`. Based on `RCTPerfMonitor`. You should treat it as a wrapper, providing full-screen, transparent view which receives no props and should ideally render one child `View`, being the root of its view hierarchy. For the example usage, see https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/blob/main/apps/src/tests/Test1096.tsx\n\n## Interop with [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation)\n\nReact-native-navigation library already uses native containers for rendering navigation scenes so wrapping these scenes with `<ScreenContainer>` or `<Screen>` component does not provide any benefits. Yet if you would like to build a component that uses screens primitives under the hood (for example a view pager component) it is safe to use `<ScreenContainer>` and `<Screen>` components for that as these work out of the box when rendered on react-native-navigation scenes.\n\n## Interop with other libraries\n\nThis library should work out of the box with all existing react-native libraries. If you experience problems with interoperability please [report an issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues).\n\n## Guide for navigation library authors\n\nIf you are building a navigation library you may want to use `react-native-screens` to have control over which parts of the React component tree are attached to the native view hierarchy.\nTo do that, `react-native-screens` provides you with the components documented [here](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/tree/main/guides/GUIDE_FOR_LIBRARY_AUTHORS.md).\n\n## Common problems\n\n### Problems with header on iOS\n\n- [Focused search bar causes new screens to have incorrect header](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/996)\n- [Scrollable content gets cut off by the header with a search bar](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/1120)\n- [RefreshControl does not work properly with NativeStackNavigator and largeTitle](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/395)\n\n#### Solution\n\nUse `ScrollView` with prop `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior=“automatic”` as a main container of the screen and set `headerTranslucent: true` in screen options.\n\n### Other problems\n\n| Problem                                                                                                                                                  | Solution                                                                                                    |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [SVG component becomes transparent when goBack](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/773)                                     | [related PRs](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/773#issuecomment-783469792)   |\n| [Memory leak while moving from one screen to another in the same stack](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/843)             | [explanation](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/843#issuecomment-832034119)   |\n| [LargeHeader stays small after pop/goBack/swipe gesture on iOS 14+](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/649)                 | [potential fix](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/649#issuecomment-712199895) |\n| [`onScroll` and `onMomentumScrollEnd` of previous screen triggered in bottom tabs](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/1183) | [explanation](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/1183#issuecomment-949313111)  |\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to this project.
